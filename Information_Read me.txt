Collab_Notebooks
- Combinations_BDG_Constructions: This script is in charge of combining all possible construction typologies to create hybrid constructions. Needs to be updated every time new building layers are introduced.
- Combinations_Constructions: This script combines the BDG dataset with the hybrid constructions and calculates the GWP, based on the extracted areas and quantities.
- EDA_Kohonen: Script to analyse data and create diagrams, such as histograms, plot charts, etc. Can be gladly extended and refined.
- LCA_ANNregression: Script to train a model based on a ANN-Regression
- LCA_SLregression: Script to train a model based on a Simple Linear-Regression
- To DOÂ´s
	- Script to introduce Energy simulation data.

Data
- BDG_v4_E1: First data extraction from BDG. To be updated.
- Dataset_V1: First complete dataset coming from Collab "Combinations_BDG_Constructions"
- LCA_DATA: Main combinatorial approach. Here all possible combinations are predefined, taking into consideration the different building elements. This file contains mainly GWP-Data. 
	- Needs to be extended for each new layer. KPIs need to be extended to evaluate more than just GWP.
	- Climate preset approach to materials is still not available. Needs to be produced.
	- U-Values and Energy Standards needs to be introduced

GH_Scripts
- Energy_Model_Export: Script to generate iterations between different energy models. Purpose is to calculate the operational carbon.
	- Climate preset approach to materials is still not available. Needs to be produced.
